# Technically, this doesn't need to be anything fancy

Why have I waited so long? Why am I still waiting to do this? When lord? WHEN? When's gonna be my time?

It just has to look decent, load quickly, be easy to get a rough draft. Jekyll for now, maybe
something else later.

## This is part of learning

Organizing your thoughts into bigger and bigger chunks, that's something that I haven't been doing.
I can rant at people, but what do I have to show them. This should be the big pieces here, then
fill in the details later.

## I can't do it all myself

At some point you'll just have to come to terms with who you are, and really play out all the
strategies to get around those limitations. I have strengths, but I have weaknesses too. I
can't keep kicking over my sand castles when they're not perfect.
