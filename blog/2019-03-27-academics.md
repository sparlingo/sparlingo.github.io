I'm wondering again if the things that I'm really interested in: social science, behavioural economics, culture, being
a contradictory prick, is that really what I should be doing. I'm trying my best to get organized, but I can't seem
to make the choice between more technical topics of study (machine learning, statistics, geophysics), and the
things that I really just love love love. It's head vs heart I guess, we'll see how it plays out but with the
baby coming now I'm really going to have to make a choice.
