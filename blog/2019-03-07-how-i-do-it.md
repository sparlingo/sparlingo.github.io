Our baby is coming in like a month from now. Great, wonderful! That's the most important thing, but this whole baby thing has really made me consider what I'm going to be doing 5 years from now, and I think by then we'll be near the peak (actually past the peak) of another speculative boom in commodities, and I'll be leaving geology for the second (and last) time. By then I want to have a serious portfolio of my own coding projects that I've been working on, and that is totally doable! How can I do it? A step at a time. 

I've been reading a lot of things lately about how people go from A to B, like people who are thoughtful about how that process works. What is the secret, THE SECRET. Do things in small chunks. Break everything down to a manageable piece and do that, and then the next thing, plan things out and follow through with the plan. I have to maintain editorial control over myself, keep myself on a target and be tenacious about it.

Github commits target: 500 before the end of this year. That means like 50 a month for the rest of the year. I can do that!
